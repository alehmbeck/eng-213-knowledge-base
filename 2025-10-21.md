According to a classmate, the Internet is used "to store information, send it to other places, and eventually, be obtained" [The Spread of Information by Sam Knebel.](https://rickwysocki.github.io/eng-213-knowledge-base/2025-09-23-knebel.html) This discussion grows even more nuanced with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into our society. Scholars and lay people alike cannot seem agree on whether or not AI should be embraced or trashed.

## Yay for AI: How AI can be Integrated in Society
"As we continue to explore the integration of GenAI, particularly ChatGPT, into the technical writing process, it is crucial for researchers and educators to engage in meaningful discussions about its role and implications" [From Hype to Practice: Reinterpreting the Writing Process Through Technical Writing Studentsâ€™ Engagement with ChatGPT by jiang et al.](https://bsu.instructure.com/courses/174253/assignments/2293653?module_item_id=6133740) In their research article, these authors discuss how students use AI to assist in the writing process rather than to fully write them a paper. They found that manny students use AI to help with the brainstorming process and create an outline to guide their writing.
In class, we even uses ChatGPT a little bit to see how helpful, or not helpful, it could be early in the writing process. I found it to be helpful personally as it gave links to resources and helped to guide a research question. We also discussed how to cite AI as a contributor. While we did not come to a solid conclusion, it is still widely acknowledged that AI should be cited as a contributor and/ or source if used in the writing process.

## Nay for AI: Why Should We be Weary of AI?
"We created this guide to add to ongoing efforts to think through approaches for responding to GenAI in writing studies, and in higher education more broadly" [Refusing GenAI in Writing Studies: A Quickstart Guide by Sano-Francini, McIntyre, and Fernandes.](https://refusinggenai.wordpress.com/) These authors are claiming that the "refusal" of AI is a principled stance that is rooted in the art of writing. They claim that the art of writing highlights linguistic diversity, ethical labor, and critical pedagogy, all of which would be diminished if AI is adopted and used. Ultimately, these authors call on educators to think critically about the implications of adopting Generative AI until it aligns more with the artful nature of writing: justice, equity, and sustainability.
